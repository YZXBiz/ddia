# Technical Content Creation Guide

_Transform technical books into engaging, learnable content_

---

## 🎯 Core Method

**Process:** Research authoritative sources → Add superior teaching → Create organized content

**Key Principle:** Use established technical structure + enhance with superior learning methods

---

## 📋 Content Structure

### Numbered TOC (Required)

```markdown
## Table of Contents

1. [Introduction](#1-introduction)
2. [Main Topic](#2-main-topic)
   - 2.1. [Subtopic](#21-subtopic)
3. [Summary](#3-summary)
```

### Header Numbering (Required)

- Main: `## 1. Introduction`
- Sub: `### 2.1. Subtopic`
- Sub-sub: `#### 2.1.1. Detail`

### Navigation (Required)

```markdown
---

**Previous:** [Link] | **Next:** [Link]
```

**Rules:**

- ✅ Every header appears in TOC
- ✅ Hierarchical numbering (1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.1)
- ✅ Working anchor links
- ❌ No orphaned entries

## 🎨 Teaching Techniques

### Analogies First

```markdown
**In plain English:** [Simple Language]
**In technical terms:** [Actual concept]
**Why it matters:** [Real-world benefit]
```

### Progressive Examples

```
Simple concept → Intermediate application → Advanced implementation
```

### Insight Boxes

```markdown
> **💡 Insight**
>
> [Key knowledge that connects concepts to broader patterns]
```

### Visual Diagrams

```
Simple Flow          Complex Reality
───────────         ─────────────
Step 1         →    Detailed Process A
Step 2         →    Detailed Process B
Step 3         →    Detailed Process C
```

### Complexity Breakdown

- ❌ "Complex enterprise architecture with microservices, event sourcing, and CQRS patterns"
- ✅ "1. Break problem → 2. Solve pieces → 3. Connect solutions → 4. Scale system"

### Code Examples

- **Explain before showing** - Context first, code second
- **Use realistic examples** - Actual commands that work
- **Show expected output** - What should happen
- **Test everything** - All examples must work
